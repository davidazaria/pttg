## What is PTTG?

(Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)

## My wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## My initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

## Phases to completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

## Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
